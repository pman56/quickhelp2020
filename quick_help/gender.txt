Ladies First

Connecting Women to Organize Protests, Fight for Justice and Gender Equity in the Society.

In the most part of the world, Girls,Women are treated as if they are not human, Some men even sees Women as their own 
landed property or sex slaves. In Africa, Girls, women do not have any say in their homes, social gatherings and communities
as most of the decision are done and concluded by men irrespective of whether it favours the woman in question or not.

A lot of young women has died of unwanted/forceful pregnancy simply because they have no one to speak for them.
Everyone should called an evil an evil when they sees it and should works towards tackling the gender
discrimantion while ensuring that justice is done.

They are numerous factors that can contributes to gender inequality and their possible way out.

1.)Use of Notorious Sexy Language: Use of Sexy languages when addressing women tends to create fear and makes the woman
feels inferior. An Employer was once seen addressing heir women employees as Girls, this is a gender discrimination of highest
order.
Men should know that women are gift from God and to that effect, every women should be treated with reference, love and care.


2.) Poverty: Lifiting Girls and Women out of extremely poverty is very essentials. this is mostly obtainable by creating
a health facilites mostly for women particulary Maternal Health Programs.

3.) Jobs/Opportunities: Women needs to sit on boards along with men in various high offices and departments to ensure
that women's issues are also at the frontline. If this is not done, then fundamental human right is not complete.
 
4.)Abolishing Gender Roles:  One of the main tools to fight for gender equity is by abolishment of gender roles at home
environments. In Africa, Girls are said and know for doing house choirs, washing plates, sweeping houses while boys will
be out there playing games, football. The domestic choirs sould not be gender biased so as to eliminate gender home domestic roles.

5.)Enterpreneurship: Women should be trained and educated to be self independent and should also learn most skills that will
help them at long run.

In most of African Countries in the Rural areas, Some women through initiative has learn and produce a washable 
Sanitary Pads for their girls 
and women. This help Girls, Women to fight gender inequality because they do not longer need to worry about what they are going to
use next month when they menstruates. This achievements simply means that Girls should be able to stay in schools instead
of staying at home during menstruation.


6)Education: Education is the key tools to fight gender inequality. In africa, Boys are valued more than Girls. If a woman 
do not have a male Child, it appears as if they do not have a child. People should be educated to know that
 Child is Child irresptive of gender type. Consequently, most families sends boys to a better school than girls. This can be attributed
to greater number of illetrate women in the society. To curtail this injustice on girls, proper educations, skills acquistions
with little capital investment will help young girls to break out of the poverty cycle.

7.) Sexual Harrasment Cases:   1 in 3 women may have experienced sexual harrasment at certain points in her life time. Gender
equity should be fight for by establishing a Law in various Communities, Countries etc. that protect Women against such sexual
threats. they should also be a reporting system to that effect so that perpetuators of the crime should be reported 
to appropriate authorities for justice to take its place.

8.) Organizing and Executing Protest: Protest is the key as it enables women to express their oppressions in their locality,
communities and to the government.

9.)Ovulation and Menstral Cycle: Boys and Girls should be allowed to learn about Sexual Education. Girls should be educated
to know what happens to their own body inside out.



What the app does and how it fights Gender Inequality:

1.) The <b>Ladies First</b> applications was ddesigned to connects Girls, women etc who needs assistance with 
those who are willing to assist them.

For Instance a woman can create a post or Video indicating that She is Offering an Enterpreneurship Assistance on
how to make a Washable Pads that can help Women during menstruation and broadcast to the community.

Another women can create a post saying that She is offering an Assistance on Jobs/Opportunities and then Broad-cast it
to the communities.

Another women can create a Post saying that she needs an Advice assistance on Sexual Harrassment by her Employeer and then share it to the community.

For example, If you mention <b>woman</b> in the Post, the <b>woman</b> will be bolded and surrounds/replaced with word<b>Admirable</b>

This will create a postive impression in the mind of the Poster that He/She is dealing with a woman and 
that the woman in question needed
to be admired and treated with utmost respect.
